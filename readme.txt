AutoVer plugin will automatically version your CSS and JS files in the generated html page (e.g. style.css?ver=1359464809).

== Description ==

AutoVer plugin will automatically version your CSS and JS files. This is especially useful when using a Content Distribution Network (CDN) for delivering static files like CSS and JavaScripts. The plugin appends to the resource URL a numeric version number generated by the filemtime() PHP function (e.g. style.css?ver=1359464809). This means the version number will be updated every time the CSS or JS file is being saved.

IMPORTANT: this plugin only works with CSS and JS files that are enqueued using the standard WordPress functions [wp_enqueue_style](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_style "wp_enqueue_style") and [wp_enqueue_script](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script "wp_enqueue_script").

== Installation ==

= Installation =
1. Upload `autover.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory;
2. Extract the `autover.zip` archive into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory;
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Alternatively go into your WordPress dashboard and click on Plugins -> Add Plugin and search for AutoVer. Then click on Install, then on Activate Now.

= Usage =
Install and activate the plugin according with the Installation instructions.
The plugin will automatically start to version your CSS and JS files that are correctly enqueued into WordPress (by using [wp_enqueue_style](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_style "wp_enqueue_style") and [wp_enqueue_script](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script "wp_enqueue_script") functions).

Depending on the caching mechanism used, a purge of page (html) cache might be needed.

If you want to version only CSS or only JS files, please check the plugin settings by going to 'Tools->AutoVer' from your WordPress dashboard.
